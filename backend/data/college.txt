ADSA Artificial intelligence and Data Science Students Association The Department of Artificial intelligence and Data has science is a newly involved department of this Institution. Education is simply the soul of a society as it passes from one generation to another. Commemorating the quote of a famous American civil rights activist, A word as to the education of the heart, we dont believe that this can be imparted through books, it can only be imparted through the loving touch of the teacher, ADSA was proposed with the objective to organize various activities that consists of drawing the goodness and best out of our own students under the guidance of the well trained faculty members of the department. INITIATIVES BEYOND THE CLASS ROOM Mentor System Each faculty member in the department is assigned the complete responsibility of 30 students. This Faculty Mentor establishes a close relationship with students, orients them to college practices, follows their progress regularly and guides them throughout the fouryear course. Employment of this idea has helped several students to solve the problems they face in the academics. Also this method helps the parents to keep track of their child and their academic performance. Remedial Education The students with backlogs have a heavy load as they must take exams simultaneously for both the new semesters subjects as well as for the subjects they fail and they cannot attend classes in the subjects they have failed. Thus, they do not get any additional teaching in the subjects in which they are weak unless they resort to coaching classes or other private means. This may in turn result in cumulative failures, leading some students to take more years to complete the fouryear engineering course. To help our students from such situations, remedial classes are provided by the AI DS department during the month before the repeat exams, enabling the students to face the difficult papers with greater confidence and ease. Placement Training Department offers intense placement training on regular basis.
