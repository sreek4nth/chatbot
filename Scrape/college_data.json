Beginning with a fourday conference in California 26 years ago, TED has grown to support ideas that change the world through multiple initiatives. At TED, thinkers and filmmakers around the world are invited to give the best speech of their lives in 18 minutes. These presentations are made available for free on the TED.com website. What is TEDx Unlike TED itself, which hosts annual global conferences, TEDx events are local and communitydriven, allowing for a wide range of topics, from technology and entertainment to education, personal development, and social issues. Each TEDx event follows guidelines set by TED but has its own unique theme and speakers, making every event distinct and relevant to its specific audience. Excellence Beyond Notice 2025 The event aimed to shed light on the oftenoverlooked contributions and efforts that lead to extraordinary achievements. The event featured a diverse lineup of speakers who shared their unique insights and experiences, inspiring the audience to recognize and pursue excellence in various fields. TEDxSJCETPalai 2025 Excellence Beyond Notice On February 8, 2025, St. Josephs College of Engineering and Technology, Palai, hosted TEDxSJCETPalai under the theme Excellence Beyond Notice. This independently organized TEDx event brought together a diverse group of thought leaders, innovators, and visionaries to explore the oftenoverlooked efforts that drive extraordinary achievements. The event opened with an address by Rev. Fr. Mathew Koramkuzha, followed by a rulebook presentation by Mr. Jithin Jaison. A distinguished lineup of speakers, including Mr. Sabarinath G. Pillai Cybersecurity Evangelist, Mr. Advin Roy Netto UX Designer at Google, Mr. Vishnu Narayanan B. HeadTalent Development, TCS Kerala, Ms. Amina Nijam Actress, and Ms. Anna Susan Roy Miss Kerala 2021 Finalist, delivered thoughtprovoking talks, sparking meaningful conversations. Beyond the speaker sessions, the event featured interactive discussions, networking opportunities, and artistic performances, enriching the experience for all attendees. The day concluded with a vote of thanks by Ms. Devanandana A. Nair, a reflection session, and certificate distribution to speakers and volunteers. TEDxSJCETPalai 2025 was a resounding success, igniting inspiration, fostering innovation and community engagement, and staying true to the spirit of TEDxspreading ideas that matter. Discover Rediscover 2022 From one moment to another, memory steps back to rediscover the past and comprehend the meaning or define its true colors. If we are to go forward, we must go back to discover and rediscover certain elements that hinge on our foundations. Our theme hence, brings light on the need to explore and discuss ideas from different and novel perspectives. TEDxSJCETPalai is also about a gentle reminder to always rediscover one another because we are forever changing. Ellipsis 2018 Ellipsis is used to define an unfinished thought about an object or a person, or a certain idea about either of them. It pushes us to concentrate deeply on our unfinished thoughts and take required actions to obtain a fruitful outcome. Connecting people to reflect and transform each other is one of the great purposes of this first edition of TEDxSJCETPalai. TEDxSJCETPalai will be a celebration of individuality.

ADSA Artificial intelligence and Data Science Students Association The Department of Artificial intelligence and Data has science is a newly involved department of this Institution. Education is simply the soul of a society as it passes from one generation to another. Commemorating the quote of a famous American civil rights activist, A word as to the education of the heart, we dont believe that this can be imparted through books, it can only be imparted through the loving touch of the teacher, ADSA was proposed with the objective to organize various activities that consists of drawing the goodness and best out of our own students under the guidance of the well trained faculty members of the department. INITIATIVES BEYOND THE CLASS ROOM Mentor System Each faculty member in the department is assigned the complete responsibility of 30 students. This Faculty Mentor establishes a close relationship with students, orients them to college practices, follows their progress regularly and guides them throughout the fouryear course. Employment of this idea has helped several students to solve the problems they face in the academics. Also this method helps the parents to keep track of their child and their academic performance. Remedial Education The students with backlogs have a heavy load as they must take exams simultaneously for both the new semesters subjects as well as for the subjects they fail and they cannot attend classes in the subjects they have failed. Thus, they do not get any additional teaching in the subjects in which they are weak unless they resort to coaching classes or other private means. This may in turn result in cumulative failures, leading some students to take more years to complete the fouryear engineering course. To help our students from such situations, remedial classes are provided by the AI DS department during the month before the repeat exams, enabling the students to face the difficult papers with greater confidence and ease. Placement Training Placement training is an integral part of the departments curriculum in the college, aimed at preparing Artificial Intelligence and Data Science students for the competitive job market. The AD department organizes comprehensive workshops and seminars to enhance students employability skills. These sessions cover various aspects such as resume writing, interview techniques, and professional etiquette. The college also invites industry experts and professionals to conduct mock interviews and provide valuable feedback to students. Additionally, the department facilitates internships and industry collaborations to expose students to realworld scenarios and foster practical knowledge. The ultimate goal of placement training is to ensure that students are wellequipped and confident to secure lucrative job opportunities upon graduation.

COPO Mapping INITIATIVES BEYOND THE CLASS ROOM Mentor System Each faculty member in the department is assigned the complete responsibility of 30 students. This Faculty Mentor establishes a close relationship with students, orients them to college practices, follows their progress regularly and guides them throughout the fouryear course. Employment of this idea has helped several students to solve the problems they face in the academics. Also this method helps the parents to keep track of their child and their academic performance. Remedial Education The students with backlogs have a heavy load as they must take exams simultaneously for both the new semesters subjects as well as for the subjects they fail and they cannot attend classes in the subjects they have failed. Thus, they do not get any additional teaching in the subjects in which they are weak unless they resort to coaching classes or other private means. This may in turn result in cumulative failures, leading some students to take more years to complete the fouryear engineering course. To help our students from such situations, remedial classes are provided by the ES department during the month before the repeat exams, enabling the students to face the difficult papers with greater confidence and ease. Placement Training Department offers intense placement training on regular basis.

To develop sensitization towards social issues and holistic development. To create the knowledge of recent technology and techniques among students. To develop an attitude for lifelong learning. To instill innate talents through sports and cultural activities. The context: The Professionals need to possess a blend of both generic skills and professional skills in order to excel in their careers and achieve success in life. The amalgamation of generic skills and professional competencies determines candidates ability to perform well in their jobs and contribute to society. Therefore, it is imperative for students to receive education and training in generic skills and professional competencies through an actionable and comprehensive plan. To accomplish this, educational institutes must develop academic calendars and design programs that incorporate best practices and methods for the development of generic skills and professional competencies. The Practice: The institute has a wellstructured and calendarbased schedule of programs and activities aimed at fostering generic skills and professional competencies. The institute offers the following programs to its students: Soft Skills Life Skills ICT Computing Skills Language Communication Online MOOC programs SWAYAM, NPTEL Certificate Addon Value added programs Sports day Cultural events NSS and outreach programs Placement details Specific training and workshops are organized for each program, ensuring that students from every department have the opportunity to enhance their professional competencies.

With the institute hosting 209 outreach programs, nearly every student is actively involved in at least one of these initiatives. The institutes concerted efforts in organizing these programs have led to a rising placement rate. In the most recent year, 500 industry offers were received for students. There has been a consistent annual increase in the number of students participating in these programs. Problems encountered and Resources required It is challenging for both faculty members and students to find time from their regular work and academic commitments to encourage students to undertake innovative and technically competent projects. The following are the problems that have been encountered: Encouraging individuals to participate in the program. Difficulty in finding time for faculty members and students due to regular classes and work. Ensuring completion of certification for the SWAYAM and NPTEL programs. Through dedicated efforts and comprehensive training right from the start, all mental barriers have been overcome. Students have actively engaged in all programs and acquired the necessary skills with the support and guidance of the faculty, mentors, and training providers. Objectives of the Practice: To establish a cooperative relationship between Institute and Industry. To encourage mutually beneficial researchoriented learning inputs for faculty and students To enhance newer technology transfer for socio economic development To bridge gap between employability and competence To augment communication and professionalism The context: The faculty development and research activities play a significant role in enhancing the performance of the institute and enable the institution to achieve its mission. These activities also empower faculty members to engage in community and regional initiatives. Furthermore, the training and research initiatives have a direct impact on students project activities and contribute to the expansion of their knowledge base. The Practice: To comprehend the skills demanded by the industry, partnerships and Memorandums of Understanding MoUs have been established with 24 organizations and industries. The institution has conducted following activities to boost research and development. The institute has implemented a policy to offer financial aid aimed at bolstering research and development. Faculty members are encouraged to participate in seminars, conferences, research projects and paper publications. A grant of 114 lakhs has been allocated to the institute for project undertakings. The college actively encourages students to participate in Idea grant competitions organized by the Kerala startup mission KSUM, and several student teams have successfully secured Idea grants from KSUM. Moreover, the institution maintains close association with chapters such as the American Society of Mechanical Engineers ASME, Society of Automotive Engineers SAE, Computer Society of India CSI, and the American Society of Civil Engineers ASCE. Evidence of Success: Students have the opportunity to engage in academic project work by visiting these industries. With the support of the industry, they design new products and write research papers. This has led to an improvement in their placement prospects. A significant number of research projects are undertaken throughout the assessment year. Faculty development programs have been attended by 42 of the faculty members. Problems encountered and Resources required: The research program plays a crucial role in the learning and development process for individuals. However, finding time amidst regular work to encourage individuals to engage in research projects poses difficulties for both faculty members. The following are the problems that have been encountered: Insufficient availability of highend equipment. Lack of qualified resource persons. Limited availability of research assignments. These challenges were overcome through the motivation, guidance, and support provided by faculty mentors and the management. To support the willingness of students and faculty members to work on their research projects, several resources were made available, including CADCAM software, assistance from the research cell, access to the library, and active participation of educators.", "Institutional Distinctiveness SJCET Palai One of the main objectives of the institution is the enlightenment of the whole society. The institutions mission is to grow into a worldclass, pacesetting institute with a unique identity and character that meets the aspirations of society. Every curricular and cocurricular activity is carried out in a way that fulfills the institutions vision and mission. The institution provides a state of the art environment and infrastructure for teaching. Faculty and students are urged to participate in research, and students receive certain moral and ethical principles that will help them succeed in life. The SJCET campus is a green campus with a lot of ecofriendly initiatives. From its inception, the management of the institution has followed a naturefriendly approach. The campus is more than 46 acres, and the major area of the campus is filled with wellmaintained greenery with thousands of plants and trees. Hundreds of birds from 36 different species have been found on campus. Among them, some are really rare to find around us. The institution makes numerous efforts to uphold the green philosophy. This has led to the development of green morals and ethics towards the environment among the staff and students. Good citizens should responsibly use water and other natural resources. Students of SJCET are sensitized for optimal use of resources from the day they commence living on campus. The institution teaches them not only engineering but also the lessons of life. Students can observe various water recycling plants and water conservation facilities on campus. Choondacherry by nature is a village with many virtues. A lot of rainfall takes place in this village. There are three main rainwater harvesting tanks in the campus. Besides, there are wellrecharging facilities developed in the campus. To maintain harmony with nature, the institute effectively balances the utilization of natural resources and the recycling of the resources. The Meteorological Centre, located on campus, can measure various metrics and store them for later use. SJCET is also an ISO 14001:2015certified institution, which adheres to the specifications for an environmental management system that an institution may utilise to improve its environmental performance. Waste management: All electronic equipments used on the campus are regularly maintained and repaired to ensure the minimum amount of ewaste. Ewaste is being disposed of as per the norms of the Pollution Control Board. In order to reduce plastic usage, most of the infrastructural elements are made of wood, glass, and other degradable materials. The use of plastic inside the campus is strictly restricted. Reusing singlesided papers will significantly reduce the amount of paper used. The campus consists of 3 biogas plants situated in hostels at SJCET. It can greatly contribute to reducing greenhouse gases, as it has the possibility of reducing the need to use fossil fuels. Hostel wastewater is collected on campus and recycled for use in farming and gardening. Energy Conservation: The institution has taken initiatives for energy conservation. SJCET owns three solar power plants on campus that will contribute to most of the energy requirements. A total of 210 kWp solar power plant generated 258532 units of electricity in 2022. The installation of another solar plant is in the pipeline. As per KSEBL regulations, we can add another 50 kWp solar power plant to the existing system. Quality Initiatives: Todays academic institutions are known for producing thousands of research papers, journal articles, and patents in addition to supporting academic activities. APJ Abdul Kalam Technological Universitys SJCET research centre offers facilities for research in five distinct fields. In this institution, 15 professors are research supervisors, and more than 51 professors are engaged in their own research. There are about 35 faculty with Ph.D.s in various fields. A little over 57 of teaching faculty are actively involved in research activities. It was emphasised to faculty and students that research participation is an important aspect of the institutions quality mission. Students take an active role in publishing the results of their research projects in reputable publications and take part in competitions related to research and projectdesign exhibitions. By offering a variety of support services to a wide range of beneficiaries, St. Josephs Centre for Industrial Consultancy is highly active in a number of sectors, including Civil Engineering, Computer Science, and Mechanical Engineering. Collaboration between industry and academics fosters technological advancement and innovation. Industry collaborations are essential for developing research and a qualified workforce. The majority of the institutions departments signed MoUs with companies that work in their respective fields. For free continual digital learning on a diverse range of topics, we have platforms like Infosys Springboard and UiPath. An Infosys Springboard student can greatly benefit from the educational initiatives and Infosys partnerships with other reputable industry resource providers like Coursera, Harvard Publications, and more. Students can use UiPath Academys platform to get certified in a wide range of technologies. Patents are a necessary component of a rapidly expanding academic institution. Patents benefit society because they encourage creativity and aid in the creation of new goods. They protect intellectual property as well. The faculty and students at SJCET are encouraged to conduct research and submit patent applications. We currently own three patents and have eleven more filed.

ADSA Artificial intelligence and Data Science Students Association The Department of Artificial intelligence and Data has science is a newly involved department of this Institution. Education is simply the soul of a society as it passes from one generation to another. Commemorating the quote of a famous American civil rights activist, A word as to the education of the heart, we dont believe that this can be imparted through books, it can only be imparted through the loving touch of the teacher, ADSA was proposed with the objective to organize various activities that consists of drawing the goodness and best out of our own students under the guidance of the well trained faculty members of the department. INITIATIVES BEYOND THE CLASS ROOM Mentor System Each faculty member in the department is assigned the complete responsibility of 30 students. This Faculty Mentor establishes a close relationship with students, orients them to college practices, follows their progress regularly and guides them throughout the fouryear course. Employment of this idea has helped several students to solve the problems they face in the academics. Also this method helps the parents to keep track of their child and their academic performance. Remedial Education The students with backlogs have a heavy load as they must take exams simultaneously for both the new semesters subjects as well as for the subjects they fail and they cannot attend classes in the subjects they have failed. Thus, they do not get any additional teaching in the subjects in which they are weak unless they resort to coaching classes or other private means. This may in turn result in cumulative failures, leading some students to take more years to complete the fouryear engineering course. To help our students from such situations, remedial classes are provided by the AI DS department during the month before the repeat exams, enabling the students to face the difficult papers with greater confidence and ease. Placement Training Placement training is an integral part of the departments curriculum in the college, aimed at preparing Artificial Intelligence and Data Science students for the competitive job market. The AD department organizes comprehensive workshops and seminars to enhance students employability skills. These sessions cover various aspects such as resume writing, interview techniques, and professional etiquette. The college also invites industry experts and professionals to conduct mock interviews and provide valuable feedback to students. Additionally, the department facilitates internships and industry collaborations to expose students to realworld scenarios and foster practical knowledge. The ultimate goal of placement training is to ensure that students are wellequipped and confident to secure lucrative job opportunities upon graduation.
